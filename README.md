ST-Pay Lite ‚Äî UPI-Based Bus Ticketing for Public Transport

ST-Pay Lite is a lightweight, QR-powered digital ticketing solution for government buses, designed for quick UPI-based fare collection. It eliminates the need for cash, reduces conflicts over change, and empowers both passengers and conductors with a simple, fast, and affordable system.

This project demonstrates how modern digital payments (UPI) can be integrated into India‚Äôs public transport with minimal infrastructure change and maximum accessibility.

Problem :- 
In many Indian states, including Maharashtra, public buses still rely solely on cash for fare collection. This leads to:

Frequent conflicts between passengers and conductors due to lack of change

No digital trail of fare collection or ticket issuance

Delays during boarding, especially during rush hours

Manual ticketing process is inefficient:
‚Üí The conductor must approach each passenger, ask for their source and destination, collect cash, print a physical ticket, and hand it over ‚Äî this consumes valuable time and energy throughout the trip

ST-Pay Lite enables digital ticketing using QR codes and UPI apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and Amazon Pay. The system supports:

Seamless UPI-based payments via Razorpay

Auto-generated 4-digit ticket IDs

Simple conductor dashboard to verify paid passengers

Admin panel to manage routes and generate QR codes

No hardware installation is required ‚Äî the entire system works via smartphones and web dashboards.
